    "\n",
    "The default way to retrieve command line arguments in a Python script is via `sys.argv`. Whenever you execute a Python script, `sys.argv` is populated with a list of command line arguments, delimited by spaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Standard Library includes the `argparse` module, which provides flexible and robust support for parsing command-line arguments. Some features included in `argparse` include:\n",
    "- Positional and/or keyword arguments\n",
    "- Optional/required arguments\n",
    "- Automatic help messages\n",
    "- Parsing datatypes\n",
    "- Conditional dependencies (i.e., arguments behave differently based on other argument values)\n",
    "\n",
    "The rough process of using `argparse` involves creating an `ArgumentParser` object, adding arguments to the object, parsing the arguments passed by the user when they ran the script, and then doing something useful with those arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll look at a demo of both `sys.argv` and `argparse`. Since argument parsing only makes sense from the command line, we will work with scripts and the command line rather than code cells in this notebook."

    "\n",
    "**Version control** software keeps track of changes you make to your code, allowing you to return to former points in time if needed. Most version control software also facilitates multiple people working on the same code base simultaneously. The most popular version control software is **Git**, which was created by Linus Torvalds (the inventor of Linux) in 2005. Other version control systems include Subversion and Mercurial, but Git is by far the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key feature of Git is storing code in centralized **remote repositories**. These are basically servers that keep a copy of the code along with all the historical changes that have been made on it. Individual coders *clone* a copy of the repository onto their local computer, make changes that get tracked by Git, and then *push* those changes back to the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "**GitHub** is an extraordinarily successful website that acts as a remote repository server along with many other features for sharing and collaboratively working on your code. Similar solutions include Bitbucket and GitLab, but GitHub is by far the most popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now going to go through a full demo (on the command line) of creating a repository, tracking the repository using Git, and then putting the repository onto Github for reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using Git, you should make sure to know the following basic commands (all of which are called from the command line):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `git clone`: Copy a repository from a remote location to your local machine.\n",
    "- `git add`: Add (\"stage\") one or more files to the list of tracked changes that will go in your next commit.\n",
    "- `git commit`: Have Git record all of your staged changes. This is like saving/checkpointing your work.\n",
    "- `git push`: Push any committed changes to the remote repository.\n",
    "- `git reset`: Revert uncommitted changes made to one or more files.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these commands take a variety of additional arguments that affects their behavior. If you forget how to use them, apply the `--help` argument (e.g., `git commit --help`) to retrieve the manual page for the command, or browse the wealth of tutorials/documentation sites available online."

    "### Unix command line utilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix comes with many built-in utilities that can be used to process and manipulate text files. Sometimes you don't even need to use Python to do simple data processing. Other times, Python can be useful as an intermediary step in a longer chain of data manipulations (we'll see how to do that later). Overall, this type of work is accomplished by using *pipes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pipes are when you feed the output of one utility directly into the input of another utility. You can chain many commands together this way. The process is pretty simple - you just separate your commands using pipe (`|`) characters, and do everything on the same line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful symbol is `>`, which will redirect the output of the final command of a pipeline into the text file following the symbol. We'll see an example of this a little later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some utilities to know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cd`: Changes your current directory.\n",
    "- `pwd`: Prints the current directory.\n",
    "- `ls`: Lists files in a directory.\n",
    "- `grep`: Finds lines in a file (or pipe) that match a string or regular expression.\n",
    "- `cat`: Prints the contents of a string to the screen (or sends them to the next step via a pipe). Also can con`cat`enate new stuff onto an existing file.\n",
    "- `wc`: Counts words (use `-l` flag to count lines).\n",
    "- `sort`: Sorts the lines in a file.\n",
    "- `uniq`: Returns only unique lines. File must be sorted first.\n",
    "- `cut`: Filters down to specific columns in a delimited file.\n",
    "- `tee`: Acts like a 't-junction' in a pipe by simultaneously printing the output of the previous step and feeding that output to another subsequent step\n",
    "- `find`: Finds files. Warning - the syntax for `find` is complicated. I can't ever remember how to use it and need to look up examples online.\n",
    "- `tar`/`gzip`/`gunzip`/`zip`/`unzip`/etc...: Apply various compression/decompression algorithms to one or more files.\n",
    "- `man`: Looks up the `man`ual pages for the program in question (e.g., `man wc` tells you how to use `wc`).\n",
    "- `sudo`: Short for `su`peruser `do`. This \"elevates\" your privileges and allows you to do high-level administrative tasks like installing/uninstalling applications and moving/editing potentially sensitive files. You'll have to enter your password every 5 minutes when using `sudo`, and you may not have permission to use `sudo` on certain linux systems (e.g., Penn's high performance computing).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Most linux distributions come with a \"package manager\" that can be used to easily install software and dependencies from the command line. It's very similar to `pip install`. Ubuntu's package manager is called `apt`. For example, you can install `git` using `sudo apt install git`.\n",
